SELECT - Determines which columns to include the query result

FROM - Identifies the tables to draw data from and how tables should be joined

WHERE - This will filter out un-wanted data â€” use AND OR etc to filter even more or chain filters

GROUP BY - Used to group rows together by a common, column value

HAVING - Filters out unwanted groups

ORDER BY - (Sorts your final results) Sorts the rows of the final result set by one or more columns; can use DESC/ASC

DISTINCT - works with select to only return distinct values
